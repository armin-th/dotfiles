# Quick Start
Install these dot files via
```
cd dotfiles
sh ./install.sh
```

After restarting your shell you can run
```
dsh [optional_session_name] # session name defaults to `dev`
```
for a tmux session that is configured with [gnu screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)-like key bindings.

You can list tmux sessions with
```
dsh ls
```

and kill tmux sessions with
```
dsh rm [session_name]
```

Inside `dsh` you can quickly open emacs configured with [spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) via the `ec` alias.

# Troubleshooting
- If you notice freezes or hanging, make sure to [update your packages](https://develop.spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html#update-packages) after launching emacs and restart emacs.

# dotfiles
These dot files are my dot files. There are many like them but these are mine! 

My dot files are my best friends. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my life.

Without me, my dot files are useless. Without my dot files, I am useless. I must run my dot files true. I must type faster than my enemy who is trying to hack me. I must hack him before he hacks me. I will...

My dot files and I know that what counts in coding is not the number of lines we write, the size of our commits, nor the coffee we slam. We know that it is the bugs that count. We will debug...

My dot files are human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn them as brothers. I will learn their weaknesses, their strengths, their exports, their configurations, their colors and their themes. I will keep my dot files clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...

Before my keyboard, I swear this creed. My dot files and I are the defenders of my code base. We are the masters of our bugs. We are the saviors of my computer.

So be it, until victory is mine and there are no bugs, but peace!
